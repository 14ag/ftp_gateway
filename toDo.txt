# Changelog – Release v2025-10-02

## What’s New

### Major Updates
- Enhanced initial configuration: Now automatically creates and opens a config file (`ftp_settings.ini`) on your desktop for FTP connection details.
- Improved device detection and connection workflow:
  - Multiple methods to detect your phone’s IP via ARP table lookup, subnet scanning, or manual entry.
  - Dynamic gateway detection using a VBS script.
  - Interactive command-line menu for connection methods and error handling.
- More robust FTP connection logic:
  - Tries fast connection first, falls back to slower subnet scan or manual modes as needed.
  - Can open an FTP explorer window to your device if the connection succeeds.
- Cleaner user prompts and improved error messaging throughout the script.

### Fixes & Improvements
- Error handling and fallback logic for various network and FTP connection issues.
- Refined dynamic menu system for easier user selection and retrying failed operations.
- Improved formatting and on-screen instructions for first-time setup and troubleshooting.
- Additional debug logging for each stage of the process.
