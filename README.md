# FTP Connection Helper (Windows)

This script uses built-in Windows tools to help you connect to an FTP server.

## How It Works
- It uses **Windows Explorer** as the FTP client.  
- It creates an **`.ini` file** on your desktop and uses this configuration for the connection.  
- It requires:
  - **PowerShell** enabled  
  - **VBScript** enabled  
    (these are needed for the helper functions)
