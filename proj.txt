if wifi and mobile hotspot and ethernet GetGateways_Strict_Debug.vbs is supposed to return all connected gateways in format gatewayName_[IP]
 eg: ethernet_1.1.1.1 wifi_2.2.2.2 mobileHotspot_3.3.3.3
 the names before the ips are the friendly names that i choose to use and they are merely representations of the adapter names.  notice gateways are in a single string joined by " " 

 i want to call this vb script from a batch script "lab.bat" and store this info in a variable 'gateways'
 procedure of the vb script:
1. check if wifi is on
2 check if im connected to a network
3 if yes find the gateway address of this network
4 store it in variable 'wifi' using the format specified eg 'wifi_2.2.2.2'
5 check if windows mobile hotspot is on
6 if yes find the gateway address of this network
7 store it in variable 'hotspot' using the format specified eg 'mobileHotspot_2.2.2.2'
8 check if im connected to an ethernet network
9 if yes find the gateway address of this network
10 store it in variable 'ethernet' using the format specified eg 'mobileHotspot_2.2.2.2'
11 for all the variables (im talking about "wifi" "ethernet" "hotspot" ) that are not empty jon them to ine string separated by space (" "). this string should be saved in the variable "gateways"
12 return this variable to the batch file to be saved in the variable "gateways" shown on screen
